4x4 Matrix Math Benchmarks (1D 16-element arrays)

1. Matrix Addition/Subtraction (element-wise):
   ≈ 2.0 x 10^-8 seconds

2. Scalar Multiplication (entire matrix by scalar):
   ≈ 1.5 x 10^-8 seconds

3. Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (4x4 * 4x4):
   ≈ 2.0 x 10^-7 seconds
   fastest = 7.98e-07 seconds
   and i just suck 
   WAIT THEY DONT LOVE YOU LIKE I DO WAIT
   Function execution time: 3.53e-07 seconds
   ❯ ./main
   Function execution time: 2.04e-07 seconds
   ❯ ./main
   Function execution time: 4.38e-07 seconds

   forgot O3 flag exists, shortened time
   but it keeps changing?
   tried again and i get 6.33e-07 da fuck

   bro this one article did it in 1.3 SECONDS FOR FUCKING 4096X4096 MATRICES WTFFF
   

4. Matrix-Vector Multiplication (4x4 matrix * 4-element vector):
   whadda fuck
   ≈ 5.0 x 10^-8 seconds

5. Matrix Transposition:
   ≈ 1.5 x 10^-8 seconds
